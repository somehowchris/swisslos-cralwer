# swiss los crawler

> Currently wip

Aiming to provide simple, fast and secure ways to crawl the swisslos website for:
- Historic lotto draws for euro millions and swiss lotto
- Historic win prices for euro millions and swiss lotto

## Why?

Swisslos as of today does not have a public facing api, if you wish to have that raw data you either have to get an excel sheet or get creative. I went the creative route.
